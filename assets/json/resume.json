      "summary": "Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are widely used to make predictions for systems with dynamically evolving features, including web applications such as social media and cryptocurrency transaction networks. While TGNNs have proven effective in these domains, their complex architectures present significant challenges for explainability. Counterfactual explanation methods offer a promising approach by demonstrating how changes to input graphs can alter model predictions. To address this, we introduce CoDy—COunterfactual explainer for DYnamic graphs—a model-agnostic, instance-level explanation method that identifies counterfactual subgraphs to explain TGNN predictions. CoDy uses a search algorithm that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with heuristic selection policies, leveraging spatial, temporal, and local gradient information to efficiently navigate a vast search space containing millions of possible explanatory subgraphs. Extensive experiments against both factual and counterfactual state-of-the-art baselines highlight CoDy's effectiveness, achieving average fidelity+ scores up to 6.11 times higher than the baselines in explaining TGNN predictions. By offering transparent and trustworthy explanations, counterfactual explanation methods like CoDy facilitate the deployment of TGNNs in real-world applications, such as fraud detection in financial networks or user behavior prediction in online platforms."
