I am excited to share that I started my scientific traineeship at the Joint Research Center of the European Commission today. In this five month traineeship I will be working at the European Center for Algorithmic Transparency (ECAT) and focusing on applying LLM Agents in the context of inspecting algorithmic systems.

I'm looking forward to spending five months in Ispra, Italy close to the wonderful nature around lago maggiore!
