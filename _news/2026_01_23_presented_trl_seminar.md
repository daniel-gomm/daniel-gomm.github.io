I presented my recent work
["Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584).
In the [TRL-Seminar](https://trl-lab.github.io/trl-seminar/) where we had a great discussion about the paper and its 
implications for future research in natural language interfaces for tabular data.
