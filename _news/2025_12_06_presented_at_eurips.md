At the [AI for tabular data workshop at EurIPS 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/eurips25-ai-td/home), I held a
spotlight presentation on our recent work
["Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584).
It was a pleasure to discuss our reflections and findings with the diverse audience at the workshop and I am looking
forward to more events with the TRL community in 2026!
