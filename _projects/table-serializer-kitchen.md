The Table Serialization Kitchen is a project based on my work on benchmarking table retrieval through dense retrieval
{% cite gomm2025metadata %}.

Use the Table Serialization Kitchen to boil your tabular data down to serializations. Provide a recipe and some
ingredients and serialize your tables in no-time. You can easily spice things up by extending Table Serialization
Kitchen with your own serialization ideas!
