First year PhD student at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica and University of Amsterdam, researching at the intersection of generative AI, information retrieval, and structured data. With my research I contribute towards democratizing insights from the wealth of structured data (tables, relational databases, spreadsheets,...).

I come from a highly interdisciplinary background in engineering, economy, and computer science and have plenty of real-world experience in industry, academia, and policy (consult my CV for more information).

In my free time I like to work on small (DIY) projects. Ever since I build my first 3D-printer when I was in high-school I've been into 3D modeling and printing. I am also very passionate about climbing, both in the local climbing gyms and in the mountains.
