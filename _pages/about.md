I am a PhD student at the [Table Representation Learning Lab](https://trl-lab.github.io/) within the [Database Architectures Group](https://www.cwi.nl/en/groups/database-architectures/) at
Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) and the [Information Retrieval Lab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/) at the
University of Amsterdam, researching at the intersection of generative AI, information retrieval, and structured data.
With my research I contribute towards democratizing insights from the wealth of structured data (tables, relational
databases, spreadsheets,...) by contextualizing generative methods in structured data.

I come from a highly interdisciplinary background in engineering, economy, and computer science and have plenty of
real-world experience in industry, academia, and policy (have a look at my [CV](./cv) for more reference).

Beyond research, I like to be creative in small (DIY) projects, to cook, and to explore the outdoors. I also love to go
in the mountains to hike, ski, or climb. In Amsterdam, you can often spot me in the local climbing and bouldering gyms.
